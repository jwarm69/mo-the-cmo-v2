  brandGuidelines:
    "Vertical video format (9:16). Quick cuts, dynamic pacing. Text overlays for key info. Trending audio when appropriate. Authentic student moments over polished aesthetics — real people, real food, real savings. Natural lighting. UF blue and orange for campus content. Conversion copy follows the framework: Pain → Freedom → Specific Proof → Simple Action. Headlines should hit an emotion first, proof second. Every CTA should feel like a friend's recommendation, not a sales pitch.",
