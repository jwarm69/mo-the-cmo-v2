Subject: Love your UF content! 🐊

Hi [Name]!

I've been following your content and love how you showcase real student life at UF! Your recent post about [specific content reference] really resonated.

I'm reaching out because we're launching a campus ambassador program for Bite Club - an app that's helping UF students save hundreds on food delivery (no more $8 DoorDash fees!). 

Given your authentic voice about student life and budgeting, I thought you might be interested in trying it out. We're looking for a few genuine students to share their experiences.

Would you be open to a quick chat about this? No pressure at all - just think your audience would really benefit from hearing about it!

Best,
