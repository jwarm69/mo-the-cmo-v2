"Honestly wish I discovered this sooner 😭

Before Bite Club:
• $300+/month on DoorDash
• Constant delivery fees adding up
• Waiting 30+ minutes for cold food

After Bite Club:
• $150/month for the SAME restaurants
• Zero delivery fees ever
• 5-minute pickup times

The extra $150/month is now my [specific use] money 💰

College is expensive enough - your food doesn't have to be.
