# Bite Club Email Lifecycle Sequences

## Trust Escalation Ladder

Every email relationship follows this progression. Never skip a step.

**Capture → Trust → Trial → Retention → Expansion**

1. **Capture**: Get the email (lead magnet, signup, event)
2. **Trust**: Prove value before asking for anything (social proof, helpful content)
3. **Trial**: Low-risk first experience (free meals, no commitment)
4. **Retention**: Reinforce the habit (savings recaps, streak tracking, new discoveries)
5. **Expansion**: Upgrade, refer, advocate (referral program, plan upgrades, ambassador)

## Offer Stack Structure

Layer offers to move users through the funnel naturally:

| Stage | Offer | Goal |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Entry** | 3 free meals, no commitment | Get first app download |
| **Activation** | First week 50% off any plan | Convert free user to paid |
| **Habit** | Savings milestone rewards ($50 saved = bonus credit) | Build ordering habit |
| **Expansion** | Refer a friend, both get $10 credit | Viral growth loop |

## Subject Line Best Practices for Students

1. **Use lowercase or sentence case** — all caps feels like spam
2. **Keep under 40 characters** — mobile preview cuts off after that
3. **Use specific numbers** — "$156 saved" beats "save money"
4. **Reference their identity** — "UF students" or "your roommate" performs better than generic
5. **Create curiosity gaps** — "The meal hack 2,847 students use" beats "Try our meal plan"
6. **Emoji sparingly** — one emoji max, and only if it adds meaning
7. **Test FOMO vs value** — A/B test "Last chance" vs "Here's what you're missing"

## Send Time Optimization (EST — UF Campus)

| Day | Best Send Times | Why |
|-----|-----------------|-----|
| Monday | 11:00 AM | Post-weekend, thinking about the week ahead |
| Tuesday-Thursday | 11:30 AM or 5:00 PM | Pre-lunch and pre-dinner decision windows |
| Friday | 10:00 AM | Planning weekend food before afternoon |
| Saturday | 12:00 PM | Late risers, brunch decision time |
| Sunday | 5:00 PM | Week-ahead planning, Sunday scaries |
