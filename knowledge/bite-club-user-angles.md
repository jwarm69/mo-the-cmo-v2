# Bite Club User Psychology Angles & Copy Frameworks

## The 6 Core User Segments

Every piece of Bite Club content should speak to at least one of these student mindsets. Each segment has a different emotional trigger and requires a different hook.

### Segment 1: Escape the Dining Hall
- **Who**: Freshmen/sophomores stuck on mandatory meal plans with use-it-or-lose-it credits
- **Core Emotion**: Frustration, feeling trapped
- **Pain**: Same food rotation, limited hours, wasted credits ($450+/year lost)
- **Hook Pattern**: "Your meal swipes expire. Our meals don't."
- **Headline Examples**:
  - "Still eating dining hall pizza for the 47th time this semester?"
  - "Your dining plan just cost you $450 in expired credits. We'd never."
  - "POV: You discover there's food outside the dining hall"
- **Battle Message vs Dining Halls**: "Works for THEIR schedule. Bite Club works for YOURS."

### Segment 2: Better Value Per Meal (Broke-But-Bougie)
- **Who**: Budget-conscious students who still want quality food, not just ramen

### Segment 3: Time-Starved Pro (Convenience Seeker)
- **Who**: Students juggling classes, clubs, part-time work, and social life
- **Core Emotion**: Overwhelm, time scarcity
- **Pain**: No time to cook, can't wait 30 min for delivery, needs food NOW between classes

  - "The restaurant your RA doesn't want you to know about"

## Conversion Copy Framework

Every piece of conversion copy should follow this 4-step structure:

### Pain → Freedom → Specific Proof → Simple Action

1. **Pain**: Name the specific frustration they feel RIGHT NOW
   - "Tired of paying $25 for a $12 meal after DoorDash adds fees?"
   - "Another $8 in delivery fees for food that arrives cold?"

2. **Freedom**: Paint the picture of life after the switch
   - "Imagine ordering real food between classes and picking it up in 5 minutes"
   - "What would you do with an extra $150/month?"

3. **Specific Proof**: Use concrete numbers, not vague claims
   - "$6.50/meal average. 20+ restaurants. Zero delivery fees. Ever."
   - "2,847 UF students saved a combined $340K last semester"

4. **Simple Action**: Make the next step feel effortless
   - "Try 3 meals free. No commitment. Just eat."
   - "Download → Pick a meal → Pick it up. That's literally it."

## Emotional Triggers by Funnel Stage

### Awareness (Top of Funnel)
- **Trigger**: FOMO, curiosity, "wait, what?"
- **Copy Style**: Surprising stats, relatable frustrations, pattern interrupts
- **Example**: "The average UF student wastes $1,200/year on delivery fees. The ones who use Bite Club don't."

### Consideration (Middle of Funnel)
- **Trigger**: Social proof, specific savings, "people like me use this"
- **Copy Style**: Testimonials, comparisons, day-in-the-life content
- **Example**: "Jordan switched last month and saved $167. She's a sophomore in pre-med who was spending $400/month on DoorDash."

### Conversion (Bottom of Funnel)
- **Trigger**: Urgency, risk reversal, simplicity
- **Copy Style**: Limited offers, free trials, step-by-step simplicity
- **Example**: "First 3 meals free. No card required. Try it between classes today."

### Retention (Post-Purchase)
- **Trigger**: Belonging, insider status, streaks
- **Copy Style**: Club language, exclusive access, member milestones
- **Example**: "You've saved $89 this month. That's textbook money. Keep the streak going."
