## Batch Shoot Production System

### The 2-Hour = 3 Weeks Formula

Batch shoot content to maintain consistency without burning out creators.

**Session Structure (2 hours)**:

| Time | Activity | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| 0:00-0:15 | Setup, outfit #1, location #1 | — |
| 0:15-0:45 | Film 4-5 "Order With Me" + "Between Classes" clips | 8-10 clips |
| 0:45-1:00 | Change outfit/location | — |
| 1:00-1:30 | Film 2-3 "$X Challenge" + "Best ___ On" | 5-6 clips |
| 1:30-1:45 | Change outfit/location | — |
| 1:45-2:00 | Film 2-3 "How It Works" + "Promo Drop" templates | 4-5 clips |

**Total Output**: 17-21 raw clips → edited into 3 weeks of content (posting 5-7x/week)

### Batch Shoot Tips
- **Outfit changes**: 3 different outfits minimum to create visual variety
- **Locations**: Use 3-4 different campus spots per session
- **Time of day**: Mix morning and afternoon light for variety
- **B-roll**: Always capture extra walking shots, food close-ups, campus scenery
- **Audio**: Record reactions and voiceovers separately if needed for cleaner sound
- **Templates**: Pre-write hooks and key text overlays before the shoot
- **Stockpile evergreen content**: "How It Works" and "Best ___ On" series don't expire quickly

### Equipment (Budget Creator Kit)
- Smartphone with good camera (iPhone 12+)
- Small tripod/phone mount ($15-25)
- Ring light or natural lighting (window light works)
- Wireless microphone ($30-50 for better audio)
